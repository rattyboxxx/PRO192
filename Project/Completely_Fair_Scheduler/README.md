# CompletelyFairScheduler (simplified simulation of Linuxâ€™s scheduling algorithm using Red  Black Tree  and  Heap  (minheap))

# Objective of this scheduling algorithm is to ensure that each process/task which is active gets  fair access  to  the  CPU.

# An unfairness value has been used to decide the priority of processes getting access to the processor

# A comparison between both the data structures can be studied
